Additional context is provided below.
This repo is my neovim config repo. I use it to store my all neovim config and keybindings.
Follow the below instructions when you are trying to provide assistance.
1. Use map as alias of `vim.keymap.set`
2. Use umap as alias of `vim.keymap.del`
3. add Description of the keybinding when you are adding a new keybinding.
